# Virtual Closet Mobile App

## Description

The VirtualCloset Mobile App is currently in development. It will be a place where users are able to save their clothes to their phone, make outfits out of them, and store their favorite outfits. The user will be able to take a picture of their item of clothing, and save it with a name, type of clothing, size, and color. Then they can take those pieces and build outfits with them, saving and naming their favorites. This means they'll be able to test outfit ideas anywhere they want, since they always have access to their closet.
